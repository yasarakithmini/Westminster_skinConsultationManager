# Westminster_skinConsultationManager

This is a Java-based Skin Consultation Management System designed to handle doctor-patient consultations in a dermatology clinic. The system allows patients to book consultations with available doctors, where the following features are implemented:

Consultation Booking: Patients can book consultations by entering personal details (name, DOB, mobile, etc.), along with the consultation date, time, and a note for the doctor.
Doctor Availability: The system checks the availability of doctors for the selected time and assigns the doctor accordingly.
Consultation Management: View and manage all consultations, including patient and doctor information.
Cost Calculation: Consultation cost is calculated based on time duration and patientâ€™s previous consultation history.

Key Features:
A table to display available doctors with their details (e.g., name, specialization, license number).
Ability to select a doctor and schedule a consultation.
Encryption of consultation notes using DES encryption for security.
Automatic assignment of available doctors or a random doctor if the selected one is unavailable.
Cost calculation based on consultation duration.
This project demonstrates the use of Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and object-oriented programming principles to model the consultation management system.
